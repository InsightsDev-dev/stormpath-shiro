Stormpath Shiro Spring Boot Example
===================================

This is basic Stormpath Spring Boot example, and serves as a starting point to introduce how Stormpath's `ApplicationRealm` can be configured via Spring.
 
If your Stormpath apiKey.properties file is not already setup, start [here](../README.md).

To run the example, use the following Apache Maven command:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
