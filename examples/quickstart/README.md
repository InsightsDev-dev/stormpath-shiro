Stormpath Shiro Quickstart Example
==================================

This simple example is based on Apache Shiro's `quickstart` example, and serves as a starting point to introduce how Stormpath's `ApplicationRealm` can be configured via a shiro.ini file.
 
If your Stormpath apiKey.properties file is not already setup, start [here](../README.md).


To run the example, use the following Apache Maven command:
```
mvn exec:java
```
