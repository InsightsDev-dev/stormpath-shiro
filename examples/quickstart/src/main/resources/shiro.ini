# Let's use some in-memory caching to reduce the number of runtime lookups against Stormpath.  A real
# application might want to use a more robust caching solution (e.g. ehcache or a distributed cache).  When using such
# caches, be aware of your cache TTL settings: too high a TTL and the cache won't reflect any potential
# changes in Stormpath fast enough.  Too low and the cache could evict too often, reducing performance.
cacheManager = org.apache.shiro.cache.MemoryConstrainedCacheManager
securityManager.cacheManager = $cacheManager

# Now integrate with Stormpath:
stormpathClient = com.stormpath.shiro.client.ClientFactory
stormpathClient.cacheManager = $cacheManager

# This apiKey is assigned to an Account in your Stormpath tenant's 'Stormpath Administrators' Directory as shown here:
#    http://www.stormpath.com/docs/quickstart/connect
# This value defaults to '~/.stormpath/apiKey.properties', you only need to set it if the file is located in a different location.
#stormpathClient.apiKeyFileLocation = ****PATH****/.stormpath/apiKey.properties

# Stormpath Realm
stormpathRealm = com.stormpath.shiro.realm.ApplicationRealm
stormpathRealm.client = $stormpathClient

# if you have more then one application in your Stormpath tenant, you will need to set 'stormpathRealm.applicationRestUrl'
# Find this URL in your Stormpath console for an application you create:
# Applications -> (choose application name) --> Details: REST URL
#stormpathRealm.applicationRestUrl = ****URL_to_Stormpath_Application****

stormpathRealm.authenticationCachingEnabled = true

# finally, tell the security manager to use the stormpath realm.
securityManager.realm = $stormpathRealm
