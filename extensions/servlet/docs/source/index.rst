Stormpath Shiro Servlet Plugin
==============================

The |project| is a drop-in plugin for `Servlet`_-based web applications that combines `Apache Shiro`_ and Stormpath's user management making it *incredibly* simple to add users management and authentication to your Java-based web application.

The plugin helps automate all user registration, login, authentication and authorization workloads as well as properly secure the web app.  It is very flexible - use only what you need or leverage the entire feature set.

And the best part? **You don't even need a database!**
